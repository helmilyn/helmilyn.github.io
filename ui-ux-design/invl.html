<p>The brief for this project was to “create the life insurance service of the 21st century” and to make the services of INVL attractive to new customers.</p>

<p>The INVL investment management and life insurance group was established in 1991 and operates in the Baltics.</p>

<h3 id="persona">Persona</h3>

<p>The process began by doing desktop research and by conducting interviews.</p>

<p>Insights from research revealed that people mistrust insurance companies, have no need for life insurance, procrastinate getting insurance or have no knowledge of it whatsoever.</p>

<h3 id="customer-journey">Customer journey</h3>

<p>Based on the interviews, four different personas were created. Together with my team, we created the persona Margus. He is a type of customer who has no need for life insurance, since he invests his money himself. He works as a software developer and enjoys the finer things in life.</p>

<p>By making his user journey, we mapped out the instance where he would get life insurance.</p>

<p>When his mother has a heart attack, she pleads his son to help her get life insurance for herself. As life goes on, Margus gets married and has a child, deciding to get life insurance himself. He does not however want life insurance for his child since he has a separate investment account for him.</p>

<h3 id="hmw-and-the-new-website">HMW and the new website</h3>

<p>This is the problem I started solving: How might we persuade him to get life insurance for his child?</p>

<p>I decided that the best option for Margus to get life insurance would be through his employer. INVL would have to actively seek potential business partners, make sales pitches and events and seminars to catch the attention of new employers. However, once they have acquired them, they would have to keep their attention.</p>

<p>To make the services of INVL attractive, I knew that improvements of their website for business partners had to be done. I added relevant statistics, a calculator to calculate the cost of life insurance for employees, and what amount they should choose based on their sector. In addition, the new potential website has testimonials and highlights the existing partners.</p>

<h3 id="digital-contract-solution">Digital contract solution</h3>

<p>If the employer offers life insurance to their employees, people will also be able to get insurance for their children. Since Margus already has insurance at INVL, I created a digital solution for him to add his child to his existing life insurance contract.</p>

<p>Right now, if customers want to apply for life insurance, they have to go to INVL’s office, have a consultation and fill out forms on paper.</p>

<p>A digital solution would make all of this a lot more convenient, quick and comfortable.</p>
