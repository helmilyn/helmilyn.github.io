The idea for this project was to create a fun way to take care of one's mental health, so that it would be easier to maintain healthy and mindful habits in the long run.

**Soulbird** is a gamified meditation app, helping you to take care of yourself whilst taking care of a little soulbird.

Coming back daily helps to grow your garden and keep your bird fed. Skipping these activities makes the garden decline.

### Onboarding

These **onboarding** screens with delicate illustrations give you tips on how to use the app. The most important thing is to be consistent to see personal and virtual results.

### Timer

Use a **timer** to keep track of your meditations, choose a fitting **background sound** and **write down your thoughts** after every session. These show up on the meditation board.

### Garden

Go to the **garden** to see all of the **plants** youâ€™ve collected through meditating and to check up on your soulbird. You can see how many meditations you need for a new plant or how many affirmations for a bigger treat.
