	<h1>About Helmilyn</h1>
	
	</div>
	<p>Hi! I’m Charlotte, a designer and illustrator based in Tallinn, Estonia. I work under the name Helmilyn.‍</p>

<p>I use both traditional and digital mediums for my art and try to convey a magical and whimsical atmosphere in my illustrations. I am inspired by nature, which is why those themes can be seen in all of my paintings.</p>

<p>In my design work, I really enjoy creating clean designs, which are not overly cluttered.
I am fond of bringing in simple vector illustrations to the designs, since they add an artistic and playful touch.</p>

<p>In addition to digital work, I enjoy learning about handicraft and fiber art in my spare time. Currently I am fascinated by knitting and sewing, more specifically inspired by vintage styles.</p>

<p>You can get in touch with me via e-mail: <a href="mailto:helmilyndesign@gmail.com">helmilyndesign@gmail.com</a></p>
