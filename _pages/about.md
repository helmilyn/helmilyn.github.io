title: About Helmilyn
---

Hi! I'm Charlotte, a designer and illustrator based in Tallinn, Estonia. I work under the name Helmilyn.‚Äç

I use both traditional and digital mediums for my art and try to convey a magical and whimsical atmosphere in my illustrations. I am inspired by nature, which is why those themes can be seen in all of my paintings.

In my design work, I really enjoy creating clean designs, which are not overly cluttered.
I am fond of bringing in simple vector illustrations to the designs, since they add an artistic and playful touch.

In addition to digital work, I enjoy learning about handicraft and fiber art in my spare time. Currently I am fascinated by knitting and sewing, more specifically inspired by vintage styles.
